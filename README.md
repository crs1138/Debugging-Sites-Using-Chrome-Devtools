# Debugging Sites Using Chrome DevTools

This is the official repository for my Pluralsight course titled *Debugging Sites Using Chrome DevTools*. 
The *master* branch contains code as it 
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it 
exists at the end of that module.

The demo code includes a Node web server. Before you can run the application you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). You will also need to install all of the required npm packages with the following command in the root folder of the project:

**npm install**

I will update this repo below with any problems or small issues reported between updates to the actual course.

Happy debugging!
